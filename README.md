# project-one

### Part 1

> **_NOTE:_**  This repo is public so no passwords or hostnames in here.

Take [this](http://openrecipes.s3.amazonaws.com/openrecipes.txt) dataset and upload it into a [free MongoDB cloud instance](https://www.mongodb.com/free-cloud-database) using Python. No hardcoding anything, file names, host names, ports, etc should all be configurable

  - The main branch is protected everything has to go through a PR
  - Everything needs to be dockerised, no running anything locally only in docker, You can set your vscode to develop inside a container using this extension https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers. This should be the first thing you get working.
  - Structure the repository in a clean way
  - Docker image must be built and pushed to Dockerhub using github actions
