# project-one

### Part 1

Take [this](http://openrecipes.s3.amazonaws.com/openrecipes.txt) dataset and upload it into a [free MongoDB cloud instance](https://www.mongodb.com/free-cloud-database) using Python.

  - The repository must be structured to python best practices.
  - Everything needs to be dockerised, no running anything locally only in docker
  - You can set your vscode to develop inside a container using this extension https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers
